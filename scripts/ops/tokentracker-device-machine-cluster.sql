-- Device -> machine cluster map for cross-device aggregation (issue #187 follow-up,
-- 2026-06-17). Backs account_usage_grouped's "within-cluster max, cross-cluster
-- sum" machine-level branch: same physical machine's device-id splits share a
-- cluster (deduped to max, no inflation); genuinely distinct machines get
-- separate clusters (summed, no lost multi-machine usage).
--
-- WHY a precomputed table, not machine_id: tokentracker_devices.machine_id is
-- ~80% NULL (old clients didn't emit it; containers / ioreg failures fall back to
-- randomUUID). So clustering is by VALUE CONSISTENCY of the hourly snapshots:
-- two devices of the same user are the SAME machine when their overlapping
-- (hour,source,model) buckets either have equal values (replay) OR one covers the
-- other (a CLI + dashboard reading the same logs out of sync = subset). Encoded
-- as: the smaller side's "exceeds" mass over the overlap is < 5% of its total.
-- Genuinely concurrent independent machines exceed each other in BOTH directions.
--
-- Only devices that land in a multi-device same-machine cluster are stored; a
-- device absent from this table clusters as itself (the RPC COALESCEs to
-- device_id), so single-device / lone-device users sum as one cluster.
--
-- 2026-06-17 NOTE: this build UNIONs tt_restore_safety_20260617 into the source
-- rows. That table holds the survivor rows deleted by the restore of the
-- over-aggressive merge cleanup; without it, a same-machine pair whose survivor
-- was emptied by the value-match restore would look non-overlapping and split
-- into two clusters (-> wrongly summed). Once sync has repopulated those buckets
-- on the live devices, a future rebuild can drop the safety UNION and run on
-- tokentracker_hourly alone.
--
-- Leaderboard divergence (intentional): leaderboard_usage_grouped keeps the
-- coarser per-(user,source,model,hour) DISTINCT-max (no cluster join), because
-- the 'total' period DISTINCT-dedupes the ENTIRE history in one pass and adding
-- the cluster sort column + join pushes it past the edge's 30s budget (502s in
-- testing; the un-clustered version runs ~13s). The cost: the ~11 genuinely
-- multi-machine users are slightly under-counted on the PUBLIC ranking (a few
-- hundred M to ~1B each, negligible against B-scale leaderboard totals), while
-- they remain EXACT in their own account view. account-source-parity only
-- asserts the cursor source list, which stays identical, so it still passes.
--
-- Rebuild: DROP TABLE tokentracker_device_machine; then re-run this.
